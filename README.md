# my-pc-rgb

A unified RGB controller for my PC.

## Background

This project addresses the limitations of OpenRGB with certain hardware:

- **ASUS Aura RGB Gen 2** devices (like the ASUS ROG Ryujin III EXTREME ARGB) are not supported by OpenRGB

## Supported Hardware

Currently integrated:
- ASUS ROG Ryujin III EXTREME ARGB
- ENE DDR5
- Corsair Lighting Node Core

**Planned:**
- ASUS GeForce RTX 5090 ROG Astral OC

## Features

- **Toggle Control** - Turn RGB devices on/off
- **Set device static color** - Set static color for all devices in sync
- **Set direct color** - Partially implemented
- **Unified Interface** - Control all components from one application

## Roadmap

1. ‚úÖ ASUS Gen 2 RGB support
2. ‚úÖ ENE DDR5 integration
3. ‚úÖ Corsair Lighting Node Core integration
4. ‚úÖ GPU support
5. ‚è≥ Solve ASUS Aura Gen 2 protocol completely
6. üìã Contribute improvements back to OpenRGB

## Future Plans

Once all personal hardware is fully supported, the goal is to contribute this functionality to the OpenRGB project for broader community benefit.

I'll help you fix the acknowledgements section in your README. Here's the corrected version:
