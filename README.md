# asus-aura-rgb-linux

A reverse engineering project focused on understanding the ASUS Aura RGB protocol, specifically targeting Gen 2 addressable headers. While OpenRGB currently supports Gen 1 addressable headers, Gen 2 implementation is nowhere to be seen.

This is primarily a personal research project, but insights and findings are welcome. Feel free to open issues or discussions if you have relevant information about the Aura RGB Gen 2 protocol.

**Important:** Do not open issues about device compatibility or functionality ("it doesn't work on my computer"). Channel configurations are hardcoded for research purposes - this is not production-ready software.

Useful contributions include protocol documentation, packet captures, and technical analysis. **PRs with code are very welcome.**

## Features

1. Toggle on/off AURA RGB devices
2. Set direct mode color
